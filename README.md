# AI-Based-Traffic-Signal

This project underscores the importance of data-driven approaches in traffic management, leveraging AI and real-time data to optimize traffic signal timings and enhance overall traffic flow and efficiency.

In this project, the goal is to create a model that can detect, classify, and estimate the number of vehicles on a road. The data collected from various sources, including dash cameras, field observations, and video cameras, is used to build a dataset. This dataset contains images of different types of vehicles, various traffic conditions, and different times of the day. The dataset is then split into training, testing, and validation sets. The model is trained on this data, and its performance is evaluated using a validation set. After training, it's tested on a separate test dataset. The trained model is then deployed to detect and classify traffic volume in real-time, showcasing a data-driven approach to traffic management.

The second part of the project focuses on designing traffic signal timings based on real-time data. The traffic data is extracted from videos, written into a CSV file, and used to calculate traffic volumes in terms of PCU/hr (Passenger Car Units per hour). The flow rates are computed and stored phase-wise in another CSV file. A Python code is developed for a traffic signal controller that uses this real-time data to adjust signal timings. The code collects and pre-processes traffic data, defines initial signal timings based on average traffic flow, and sets thresholds for adjusting signal timings based on flow rates. It then adjusts signal timings based on real-time data, increasing or decreasing green times for each phase as needed to optimize traffic flow.
